Now,
Flutter clean

Choose to allow notifications 

Look into the pre-crafted schedules. Then, create and manage your own! Try setting a task for two minutes (or however long you would like it to be for) from now, change the label and message, then do some other fun things in the app, until the notification appears, and the message is read out!
